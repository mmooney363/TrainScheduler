# TrainScheduler
This project is an application that shows a list of trains. The list includes the name of the train, the destination, the first train time, and the frequency.

This project was designed and built by Mike Mooney using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery and Firebase.

Trains can be added to this list by the user by using the form on the page to add the information. The train infromation will then show up in a new row on the page and the information will also be stored in the Firebase database.

The information is stored in a Firebase database and can be accessed from any computer.

This project is web-based and can be used with most web browsers.
